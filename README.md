# cyno-clicker

Cyno Clicker is an incremental game based on the likes of Cookie Clicker and similar but with a twist - everything is Genshin Impact!

From the music, to the icons and currency most things have Genshin as their theme.

Here I will do version reports and keep track of my progress through time.

Happy gaming!
